Throw in some stellar casting , and 2024 already looks set to start \\nwith a bang.  Harold Pinter Theatre, from 27 January  \\n2. Minority Report  \\nPhilip K Dick’s sci -fi detective short story (famously adapted into a film with \\nTom Cruise) is now brought to the stage by David Haig. With a wad of \\nphilosophical musing about the nature of free will and crime fighting, we can \\nsee why this one would be an appetising theatre offering.  Nottingham \\nPlayhouse, from 16 February, before stops at the Birmingham Rep and \\nLyric Hammersmith Theatre   \\n3. The Picture of Dorian Gray   \\nIn 2023 we had  Andrew Scott doing solo  Vanya,  this year we’ve \\ngot Succession  star Sarah Snook returning to the London stage to tackle \\nevery role in a new version of Oscar Wilde’s  The Picture of Dorian \\nGray,  adapted for the stage by Kip Williams. The show was a major success \\nin Melbourne, so we’re excited to see what Snook does with the material now \\nthe show’s in London.

Wish You Weren’t Here  \\nKatie Redford’s new play looks to continue a fantastic streak of new writing \\nprogrammed by Sheffield Theatres, co -producing with the Theatre Centre. It \\nfollows a mother and daughter, emotionally worlds away from one another as \\nthey embark on holiday togeth er. The piece will then embark on a tour after its \\nSheffield spell.
